# WorkoutTimer-
Xamarian based Android App developed to keep time during a workout

Out of curiosity, I tried to create an WorkOutTimer App in Xamarian Forms (.Net based platform) and in Android Studio (Java based platform). Aim was to study the differences in both platforms. I aim to write a blog on it soon.
